# SheepyBank

LIVE WEB APP: https://sheepybank.web.app

Hey guys, welcome to my first, let's call it FULL-STACK Project. As you can read from the name of the repo, it includes:
1.) **React** - this is not my first touch with React (of course I needed to create one 'TOOOO-DOOOO' list app), and this time, I just wanted to throw myself into something 'more complicated' and of course to show my recently learned skills. 
2.) **Tailwind CSS** - this is by far the thing that I couldn't wait to start implementing in my projects. Personally, I think it's much easier to do the simple - quick CSS and also to do the complex ones as you wish- in detail. I also like that it is the 'mobile first design'. I needed to optimize this app for mobile devices, of course, you want to have your Tracking Expense and Savings App as close as possible to your hand, and I did it in one hour(editing over 1000 lines of code) - just because I am used to Tailwind. There are also a lot of libraries, I needed to use Daisy UI for that circle progress bar... Also, I have some experience with MaterialsUI(I created that TODO APP using MUI, but didn't want to push to GitHub, because it's nothing special) 
3.) **Firebase** - this is my first contact with NoSQL databases, for previous projects I usually used prebuilt APIs. I've chosen Firebase this time.
4.) **Framer Motion** - also something I always wanted to create animations with, especially Parallax and those things. It's easy, but everything is similar and overused... and it affects usability a lot.

**THE IDEA OF THE PROJECT:** Create something different than others. I also wanted to make it usable for myself and others around me. I wanted to combine the Budget App and Expense Tracking App together, and I did it successfully. Everyone has the Piggy Bank to save, but the SheepyBank is better because you save more(by using the expense tracker).

_Landing Page:_ The idea was to represent chaos with those animations. Simplicity is there to boost the usability. I've implemented Google Authentication, in my opinion - the quick and safe option for everyone. When signed in, automatically redirected to the home page!

_Home Page:_ Everyone likes to have a clear dashboard. I think it can't be easier than this to use on both: smartphones and desktops. Everything you need to see is in one scroll, and there are two circles of the progress of the first two savings, just to give you awareness of the savings page, and you never forget about those savings.

_Savings Page:_ The whole website is simple, and to make it more simple I've used modals for creating saving goals and depositing/withdrawing money from each goal.

That's it. I think I'm ready for my next goal - Next.js :)
